- As a user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can save locations.
- As a user, I want to be able to log into my created account so that I can view the locations I have saved.
- As a user, I want to be able to save destinations I am interested in to a list.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete destinations I am no longer interested in so that I can have a concise list.
