**Issues we planned to address:**

Frontend:
- Display main search page 
- Display destination information after search
- Create a login and account creation page
- Create page to show list of saved destinations

Backend:
- Establish a connection with a database 
- Allow user info to be put into database
- Authenticate users who are logging in
- Use Yelp API to get destination information
- Store a list of saved destinations



**Issues successfully completed:**

Frontend:
- Created a homepage and navigation
- Created a user login page
- Created a saved destination list page

Backend:
- Set up connection with database
- Satabase stores user login information
- Searching for destination information with Yelp API



**Issues not sucessfully completed and why:**

Frontend:
- Display information after search (requires coordination with backend to display the yelp API information)
- Display saved destination list (Started, but not finished yet)

Backend:
- Password authentication (implemented storing user login last, didn't get to authentication yet)
- Storing a list of saved destinations (didn't get to this yet)
