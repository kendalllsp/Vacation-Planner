**User Stories:**
- As a site visitor, I want to be able to input a destination so that I can view places to visit in this destination.
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can save locations.
- As a user, I want to be able to log into my created accout so that I can view the locations I have saved.
- As a user, I want to be able to save destinations I am interested in to a list.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete desinations I am no longer interested in so that I can have a concise list.



**Issues we planned to address:**

Frontend:
- display main search page 
- display destination information after search
- create a login and account creation page
- create page to show list of saved destinations

Backend:
- Establish a connection with a database 
- allow user info to be put into database
- Authenticate users who are logging in
- Use Yelp API to get destination information
- store a list of saved destinations



**Issues successfully completed:**

Frontend:
- created a homepage and navigation
- created a user login page
- created a saved destination list page

Backend:
- set up connection with database
- database stores user login information
- searching for destination information with Yelp API



**Issues not sucessfully completed and why:**

Frontend:
- display information after search (requires coordination with backend to display the yelp API information)
- display saved destination list missing add and remove button and ability to dynamically change the list depending on user (didn't get to this yet)

Backend:
- password authentication (implemented storing user login last, didn't get to authentication yet)
- storing a list of saved destinations (didn't get to this yet)
