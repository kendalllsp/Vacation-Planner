Boilerplate Read Me:

First, ensure that you have Angular CLI, NPM and Go installed correctly on your system.

Now, clone (or download) the repository into the src folder (or any sub-folder of it) in either /Users/*your_name*/go on Linux, or C:\*your_name*\go on Windows.

In a terminal window, navigate into the folder that is contained by the cloned project repository.

Now, by typing the command 'npm run install-dependencies', your machine should install all necessary dependencies for our project to run.

From here, you may run 'npm start', to fire up both Angular's front-end framework and Go's server-side framework. Or run 'ng test' to run unit tests provided by Karma. For more info on Angular's  refer to https://angular.io/cli.
