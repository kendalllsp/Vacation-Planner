# CEN3031: Travel Planner

We are building a Travel Planner that allows the user to type in where they want to go, and what month of the year they're planning on going. 
Then our program will output the recent weather trends over the last couple years, 
local food/entertainment spots with the best reviews, etc. 
If results havenâ€™t been determined for that destination and time frame, 
we will fetch the info and input it in the database. 
If it has already been searched (destination and month) then we can search the database for the already fetched information. Using OpenWeatherAPI, YelpAI, and more(TBD), we will be able to create a seamless interface for our travel-ready users.
