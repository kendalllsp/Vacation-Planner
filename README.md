# CEN3031 Project (Travel Planner)

Project Name: Travel Planner

Project Description: We are building a Travel Planner that allows the user to type in where they want to go, and what month of the year they're planning on going. Then our program will output the recent weather trends over the last couple years, local food/entertainment spots with the best reviews, etc. If results havenâ€™t been determined for that destination and time frame, we will fetch the info and input it in the database. If it has already been searched (destination and month) then we can search the database for the already fetched information. Using OpenWeatherAPI, YelpAI, and more(TBD), we will be able to create a seamless interface for our travel-ready users.

Boilerplate Read Me:

First, ensure that you have Angular CLI, NPM and Go installed correctly on your system.

Now, clone (or download) the repository into the src folder (or any sub-folder of it) in either /Users/*your_name*/go on Linux, or C:\*your_name*\go on Windows.

In a terminal window, navigate into the folder that is contained by the cloned project repository.

Now, by typing the command 'npm run install-dependencies', your machine should install all necessary dependencies for our project to run.

From here, a successful run of 'npm start' finishes with "Browser application bundle generation complete" and "Compiled successfully". Although, it is worth testing against Angular's built in unit tests. To do so, run 'ng test', which auto-opens its own Chrome window to test against our project.

Lastly, while during a successful 'npm start' in Chrome, you may open the JavaScript console to show you any potential back end errors in real time.

For more info on Angular's docs refer to https://angular.io/cli.
